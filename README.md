# MY Flask App : Playlister
<hr>

Playlister application is Flask app in which I used Flask framework as backend and MongoDB as database and for backend, I use HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Here is my app: <a href="https://playlister-pj.herokuapp.com/">Playlister</a>.

On the first click, the user will go to on home page in which all playlisted are listed I make. On the homepage, there is a nav bar with **`Playlister`** 
heading than **New playlist** button, search bar, playlists with title and description, and at the bottom footer.
Now, when you click on any of the playlists, you see the playlist title, date-time, description, and videos. and below videos, there is an edit and delete button. After that there is 
Add a comment section and its delete button.

So, when you click on New Playlist you will see a form that has Title, Description and Video URL fields which take Playlist Title, Description and Video URL ID respectively.
